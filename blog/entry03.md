## Content
I was thinking of ideas to improve sports. I called it "My inventions". My inventions include:

* AI refs
* Hype-O-Meter
* Ball tracking
* Play Maker

#### AI refs
AI refs is a idea I created because of multiple people: 
* Bryce Harper
* Draymond Green

Both Harper and Draymond are complainers. They complain about every call that does not go there way and they aruge with the umpires. With AI refs they can't complain because the call becuase it will be the correct call. There will be no more complainers in sports with AI refs.

#### Hype-O-Meter

#### Ball tracking

#### Play Maker

### Finalizing Content
I had to 

## EDP
I am currently in the thrid stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to brainstorm possible solutions to the problem. Why I think I am in this step in the Engineering Design Process is I am making ideas to solve the problem. The next stage is to plan the most promising solution to resovle the issue.

## Skills 
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned since working on the last blog are **Creativity**, and **Problem decomposition**.

### Creativity
I have never thought I can be creative or orignal. I have never had that type of characteristic in me. But working on my new inventions I did not have orignal ideas but I put a creative spin on the ideas I copied. For exapmple the _Hype-O-Meter_ I copied from a YouTube channel called **Underdogs Gaming** where I stole the Chill-O-Meter which calculates if something cool happened. What I did was take that change it into the _Hype-O-Meter_ and the Hype-O-Meter calculates how hype something is. Now I can feel like I can use my creativeness to make more ideas for more unsolved problems.

### Problem decomposition
The problem I am trying to solve is a big problem. What I have to do is break down the problem to not get overwhelmed. What I did was I focused on what needs to be improved and think of an idea to fix it. That is where I got the idea of AI refs. The biggest problem in sportes is dealing with a incorrect call. Ai refs will never make a incorrect call. This is what I did for all my new inventions. Now I can feel like I can use my abillity to decompose a problem solve unsolved problems.

## Next Steps
I look forward to what comes next!
