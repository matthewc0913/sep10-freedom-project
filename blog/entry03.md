## Content
I was thinking of ideas to improve sports. I called it "My inventions". My inventions include:

* AI refs
* Hype-O-Meter
* Ball tracking
* Play Maker

### AI refs
**AI refs** is a idea I created because of multiple people: 
* Bryce Harper
* Draymond Green

Both Harper and Draymond are complainers. They complain about every call that does not go there way and they aruge with the umpires. With **AI refs** they can't complain because the call becuase it will be the correct call. There will be no more complainers in sports with **AI refs**.

### Hype-O-Meter
The **Hype-O-Meter** is to tell how hype something is. Hype is a slang that means _to make people excited about or interested in something or someone_. I thought about this idea when Bryson Stott hit a grand slam in the MLB postseason. Examples of plays that the **Hype-O-Meter** can be used for are:
* Home run/ Grand Slam
* Interception
* Goal
* Hat trick
* Golden Goal
* Penalty kick
* Slam Dunk
* Touchdown
* Walk Off
* No Hitter/Perfect Game
* winning a game
* Overtime/Extra innings
* Winning the World Series/NBA Champions/NBA In-Season Tornament/Super Bowl

These are only a few example on how the **Hype-O-Meter** can be used.

Caluations for the **Hype-O-Meter** are as goes: 

1. Win percentage difference
2. Add Loudness of the crowd (dB)
3. Add The number of inning (Only for baseball), the quarter number (Football/Basketball), the period (Hockey), Number of mintue (Soccer)
4. Divide by 100
5. Round to nearest whole number

This is also a new stat called _Hype_ which is the number after the caluations for the **Hype-O-Meter**. The **Hype-O-Meter** will improve sports in a big way.

## EDP
I am currently in the thrid stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to brainstorm possible solutions to the problem. Why I think I am in this step in the Engineering Design Process is I am making ideas to solve the problem. The next stage is to plan the most promising solution to resovle the issue.

## Skills 
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned since working on the last blog are **Creativity**, and **Problem decomposition**.

### Creativity
I have never thought I can be creative or orignal. I have never had that type of characteristic in me. But working on my new inventions I did not have orignal ideas but I put a creative spin on the ideas I copied. For exapmple the **Hype-O-Meter** I copied from a YouTube channel called _Underdogs Gaming_ where I stole the Chill-O-Meter which calculates if something cool happened. What I did was take that change it into the **Hype-O-Meter** and the **Hype-O-Meter** calculates how hype something is. Now I can feel like I can use my creativeness to make more ideas for more unsolved problems.

### Problem decomposition
The problem I am trying to solve is a big problem. What I have to do is break down the problem to not get overwhelmed. What I did was I focused on what needs to be improved and think of an idea to fix it. That is where I got the idea of **AI refs.** The biggest problem in sportes is dealing with a incorrect call. **AI refs** will never make a incorrect call. This is what I did for all my new inventions. Now I can feel like I can use my abillity to decompose a problem solve unsolved problems.

## Next Steps
I look forward to what comes next!
