## EDP
I am currently in the thrid stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to brainstorm possible solutions to the problem. Why I think I am in this step in the Engineering Design Process is I am making ideas to solve the problem. The next stage is to plan the most promising solution to resovle the issue.

## Skills 
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned since working on the last blog are **Creativity**, and **Problem decomposition**.

### Creativity
I have never thought I can be creative or orignal. I have never had that type of characteristic in me. But working on my new inventions I did not have orignal ideas but I put a creative spin on the ideas I copied. For exapmple the _Hype-O-Meter_ I copied from a YouTube channel called **Underdogs Gaming** where I stole the Chill-O-Meter which calculates if something cool happened. What I did was take that change it into the _Hype-O-Meter_ and the Hype-O-Meter calculates how hype something is. Now I can feel like I can use my creativeness to make more ideas for more unsolved problems.

### Problem decomposition
The problem I am trying to solve is a big problem. What I have to do is break down the problem to not get overwhelmed. What I did was I focused on what needs to be improved and think of an idea to fix it. That is where I got the idea of AI refs. The biggest problem in sportes is dealing with a incorrect call. Ai refs will never make a incorrect call.

## Next Steps
I look forward to what comes next!
