## Content
I had to find and thinker with a tool for my freedom project. 

### A-frame
I decided to use the tool a-frame. A-frame uses a 3D space to visualize your code. In a-frame you can create shapes to create your idead. The shpaes you can create are:

* Box
* Circle
* Cone
* Cylinder
* Dodecahedron
* Octahedron
* Icosahedron
* Plane
* Ring
* Sphere
* Tetrahedron
* Torus
* TorusKnot
* Triangle

I'm not going to go through each shape but with those shapes you can rotate them, change their color, expand their width, and hight.

### Thinkering
I thinkered with a-frame by creating a triangle, moving it around, changing the color from pink to white. Also I change the size of a plane, I change the height of a box, and I changed the sky's color from light blue to purple. I changed other stuff that you can see in the code below.

The code:
```
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-10.76 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" height=".259" color="white"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -3.5" radius=".25" width="5" color="white"></a-sphere>
      <a-triangle position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height=".5" color="white"></a-triangle>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="100000" height="100000" color="#C17E0F"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="purple"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>

```



## Next Steps
I am looking forward to what comes next!
