## Content
I had to present my freedom project website.

### In class
I had to give a presentation in class about my Freedom Project website. We had to talk about how and why we made the website. I talked about the code I used to make the website and why I made the website. I also talked about why I choose this topic for my Freedom Project. Some takeaways I had was:

* To not studder
* To not rush through it the slides
* To not too long in each slide
* Stay calm
* Be ready for any question
* Don't look at just one person look at everyone 

This is some takeaways I had presenting my website in class.

## EDP
I am currently in the fifth stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to plan out the most promising solution and create a prototype. Why I think I am in this step in the Engineering Design Process is I need to build the prototype and test it out. The next stage is to test and evaluate the prototype.

## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned persenting my Freedom Project website are **Attention to detail**, and **Time management**.

### Time management
I had to learn how to manage time going through my presentations. I have to know how much time I have spent on each slide or section. How much longer my presentation is and how much longer I want the presentation to go for. So I have to know time management to get through my presentations without any problems.

### Attention to detail



## Next Steps
I am looking forward to what happens next year in SEP!
