## Content
I had to learn and thinker with my tool A-frame for my freedom project.

### The beginning
During the beginning of learning A-frame what I did was create a box, a sphere, a cylinder, a plane, and the sky. I also changed the color of every shape to a different color from they was before. For example I changed the box's color to green, the cylinder's color to red, the sphere's color to yellow, the plane's color to brown, and the sky's color to light blue. This was to test out A-frame's 3D capability.

##### The beginning code 
```
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="green"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="yellow"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="red"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="brown"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="lightblue"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

### The middle
During the middle portion of learning A-frame what I did was created more shapes like a triangle, rings, cones, and circle. I also moved around the shapes I already had. For example I enlongated the plane so it can look like a big field instead of a little plane.

### The end
During the end of learning A-frame what I did was created a white box a increased the height and length to make it seem bigger, and I made another  cylinder to make the cylinder circle around the sphere and have the white box color change to purple.

##### The end code

```
<a-scene>
      <a-box position="-1 .5 -2" rotation="0 45 0" color="green"></a-box>
      <a-box position="-5.5 .5 -9.1" rotation="0 45 0" color="purple"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.5" color="yellow"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="red"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 -.2 -4" rotation="-90 54 88" width="400" lengh="400" height="4" color="brown"></a-plane>
      <a-cylinder position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.5" color="black"> </a-cylinder>
      <a-sky color="lightblue"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
```

## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned since learning A-frame are **Embracing failure**, and **Debugging**.

### Debugging
To learn A-frame I needed to debug code when something did not work. When there are errors in my code I know I did something wrong. What I will do is I will try to see what the problem is and try to debug it but I am not learning that way. Now I learn from my mistakes and now debugging an error feels like I learned something and not just deduged the error to fix my mistakes. Now I know how to use debug more effectively. 

### Embracing failure
To learn A-frame I needed to embrace failure when something did not work. When I write code I think it's going to work everytime and that is not true. So every time something fails I try to learn from it. Either reading my code, and debug the code or see what I did wrong and redo it. This is how I'm embracing failure.

## Next Steps
I am looking forward to what comes next for my freedom project!
