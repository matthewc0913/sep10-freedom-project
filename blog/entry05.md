## Content
I had to learn and thinker with my tool A-frame for my freedom project.

### The beginning
During the beginning of learning A-frame what I did was create a box, a sphere, a cylinder, a plane, and the sky. I also changed the color of every shape to a different color from they was before. For example I changed the box's color to green, the cylinder's color to red, the sphere's color to yellow, the plane's color to brown, and the sky's color to light blue. This was to test out A-frame's 3D capability.

##### The beginning code 
```
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="green"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="yellow"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="red"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="brown"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="lightblue"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

### The middle
During the middle portion of learning A-frame what I did was created m ore shapes like a triangle, rings, cones, and circle. I also moved around the shapes I already had. For example I enlongated the plane so it can look like a big field instead of a little plane.

### The end

## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned since working on the last blog are **Embracing failure**, and **Debugging**.

### Embracing failure
To learn A-frame I needed to embrace failure when something did not work.

### Debugging
To learn A-frame I needed to debug code when something did not work.

## Next Steps
I am looking forward to what comes next for my freedom project!
