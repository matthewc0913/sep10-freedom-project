## Choosing a topic

The topic I decided on for this project is sports due to the fact that I’ve been playing sports since I was 3 years old. Since I have been interested in sports for a long time, I would want to try to find a new way to incorporate technology into sports. I considered making this project about music or food production, but I soon decided that sports would be the best choice. Although I didn’t pick these ideas, researching them was very enjoyable. but the piece of text that made me the most inclined to pick sports was ["20 Ways Technology Makes Sports Better"](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/773227-20-ways-technology-makes-sports-better) by Austin Schindel Seeing all of the different ways new technology has been implemented in sports was truly intresting and made me even more passionate about sports than I already was.

## EDP 

I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to define the problem. The problem that I hope to solve with my project is that people are not informed about the world of technology in sports. The next stage is to research the problem and I plan to use articles and websites to resovle the issue.

## Skills

Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, **how to google**, and **communication**. 

#### Time management

I have several commitments outside of school, being on a baseball team, and being in a gaming club two days a week. But my workload at school is becoming busier, so I needed to make more time for this project as well as my other classes. So I decided to cut back from two days of gaming club per week to just one day per week. I think this change will help moving forward.

#### How to Google

When I Googled _technology in sports_, I don't want to look at 2.74 billion results. But looking at the titles and descriptions was helpful, Seeing titles of articles like. ["20 Ways Technology Makes Sports Better"](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/773227-20-ways-technology-makes-sports-better) was more along the lines of what I wanted to find. Plus, changing my search from _sports and technology_ to _technology in sports_ also helped narrow the results down to what I wanted to see.

#### Debugging

Another skill that I also achieved was **Debugging**. I have stuggled with some things in this class. How I sloved this issue is I practiced what I was needing help on and took notes also I watched video's, and read articles, and I talked my self through this problem. Now I feel like I can debug anything I miss up on.

## Next steps

I look forward to researching how technology help sports develop!
