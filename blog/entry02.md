### What I found
I was researching how software and hardware affects sports. What I found was many different ways how software and hardware affect sports. For example:

* Video footage
* Decreasing the risk of an injury
* Replay Systems
* Enhance their athletic performance
* The normal viewing experience
* Strategies
* Optimizing performance outcomes

### How I found it 
How I found this infomation is I googled software in sports and hardware in sports. I clicked on website that I wanted to see and I can skimed it untill I got the infomation that I needed. 

## EDP
I am currently in the second stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to research the problem. Why I think I am in this step in the Engineering Design Process is I have been researching the problem. The next stage is to brainstorm possible solutions to resovle the issue.

## Skills 
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are **how to google**, and **organization**.

### Organization
I have always been a unorganized person. But for school and mostly for this computer I have learned to have organized my tabs into folders to each class. For example my SEP folder has websites like:

* Github
* Sep10 Notes
* Hstat Sep students page

Now I can feel like I can focus on one class at a time with this trick.

### How to Google
When I Googled _software in sports_, I don't want to look at 1.5 billion results especially the results I have already seen or the results that have nothing to do with technology or sports. That is why I have learned that the hyphen (**-**) tells Google that you do not want pages that contain this word to appear in your results. So I have been use the hyphen in my google searches to help me filter my google searches.

## Next Steps
I look forward to what comes next!
