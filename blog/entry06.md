I had to create a MVP for my freedom project website.

### What is a MVP
A MVP in sports is a million times different that the MVP we are talking about here. The MVP in sports stands for most valuable player but this MVP stands for minimum viable product. This means the least you can make but it still works properly. For example instead of working piece by piece you can make something that works and then expand it. This is what this verison of MVP means.

### The beginning
During the beginning of creating my freedom project website I had to know what was important enough to make it in the website. First I added a title, navbar, the topic and the context. Here is the code:

```
 <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="#Context">Context</a>
                  </li>
                  <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="#Past Inventions">Past Inventions</a>
                  </li></li>
                  <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="#My new Ideas">My new Ideas</a>
                  </li></li>
                  <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="#A-frame">A-frame</a>
                  </li></li>
                  <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="#Extra Info">Extra Info</a>
                  </li>
                  </ul>
                  </div>
                  </div>
                  </nav>
                  <h1>Freedom Project</h1>
                  <div class="container">
                    <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-md-12">
                    <div id="Topic">
                  <h3 class="Topic">Topic</h3>
                  <p>My topic is sports. I choose sports because I am a fan of sports. I am a baseball player. My passion is sports. This is why I choose sports as my topic.</p>
                  <div class="container">
                    <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-md-12">
                    <div id="Context">
                  <h3 class= "Context">Context</h3>
                  <p>When people think of sports they think of playing, watching, winning, losing and having a good time. But no one thinks of the software or hardware. Maybe because they donâ€™t understand it. Maybe they don't care. But without technology you would have no way to watch your favorite teams, players or your favorite sports. Without technology players would get injured more, bad calls get reversed, and how good or bad your favorite players are doing. Coaches would need technology to know what is the right play in the situation. So maybe when you think about sports you should also think about how technology affects it.
                  </p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
```

### The middle 
After I coded that, I decided to add a picture, and add a few more paragraphs to repersent Part A and B.

```
body {
    background-image: url("plainpic.jpeg");
    opacity: 1;
```

```

```

## Next Steps
I am looking forward to build something better for my freedom project website!
