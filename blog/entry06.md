I had to create a MVP for my freedom project website.

### What is a MVP
A **MVP** in sports is a million times different that the _MVP_ we are talking about here. The **MVP** in sports stands for most valuable player but this _MVP_ stands for minimum viable product. This means the least you can make but it still works properly. For example instead of working piece by piece you can make something that works and then expand it. This is what this verison of MVP means.

### The beginning
During the beginning of creating my freedom project website I had to know what was important enough to make it in the website. First I added a title, navbar, the topic and the context. Here is the code:

```
 <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="#Context">Context</a>
                  </li>
                  <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="#Past Inventions">Past Inventions</a>
                  </li></li>
                  <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="#My new Ideas">My new Ideas</a>
                  </li></li>
                  <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="#A-frame">A-frame</a>
                  </li></li>
                  <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="#Extra Info">Extra Info</a>
                  </li>
                  </ul>
                  </div>
                  </div>
                  </nav>
                  <h1>Freedom Project</h1>
                  <div class="container">
                    <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-md-12">
                    <div id="Topic">
                  <h3 class="Topic">Topic</h3>
                  <p>My topic is sports. I choose sports because I am a fan of sports. I am a baseball player. My passion is sports. This is why I choose sports as my topic.</p>
                  <div class="container">
                    <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-md-12">
                    <div id="Context">
                  <h3 class= "Context">Context</h3>
                  <p>When people think of sports they think of playing, watching, winning, losing and having a good time. But no one thinks of the software or hardware. Maybe because they don’t understand it. Maybe they don't care. But without technology you would have no way to watch your favorite teams, players or your favorite sports. Without technology players would get injured more, bad calls get reversed, and how good or bad your favorite players are doing. Coaches would need technology to know what is the right play in the situation. So maybe when you think about sports you should also think about how technology affects it.
                  </p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
```

### The middle 
After I coded that, I decided to add a picture, and add a few more paragraphs to repersent Part A and B.

```
body {
    background-image: url("plainpic.jpeg");
    opacity: 1;
```

```
<div class="container">
                <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <div id="Past Inventions"></div>
              <h3 class= "Past Inventions">Past Inventions</h3>
              <p>People have made inventions in the past using technology. Some inventions are:</p>
              <li>Wearable player tracking devices</li>
              <li>Instant Replay</li>
            `
              <p>Technology has affceted some parts of sports that did not use technology in the past. For example scouts have scouted their talent based on guts, feelings and instincts. That's how Micheal Jordan signed with Nike to make his shoes. Now, through technology, scouts have a lot of information on how fast an athlete can run, how high they can jump and how hard they can throw and many other stats. Not to mention how techonogy has affected safety for players. Without technology wathletes would continue to get hurt at a constant rate. But their is still room for improvement. I have ideas for 4 new inventions that with technonlgy with can make sports better than what it is now. </p>
              <img src="mlb.webp" alt="MLB Instant Replay in NYC" width="1000" height="100">
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <div id="My new Ideas"></div>
              <h3 class= "My new Ideas">My new Ideas</h3>
              <p>I have ideas that could change the way people look at sports forever. Some ideas that I have are as followed. </p>
              <li>AI umpires/refs</li>
              <li>Ball tracking</li>
              <li>Play Maker</li>
              <li>Hype-o-meter</li>
              `
              <p> The Ai umpires and referees is a physical robot that referees your favorite sport. With AI umpires and referees no more time can be wasted with replays because the umpires and referees are 100% accurate. Players like Bryce Harper and Draymond Green can't complain about calls anymore because the calls are not wrong. There will never be a missed call again. The Ball tracking devicee goes inside the ball that the sport is using. With Ball tracking you get to see how far, and fast the ball goes when it is hit, thrown, or kicked. You also get to see the spin rate of the ball too. For example if Alex Wood throws a ball 93 mph to Mookie Betts and Mookie hits it 421 feet at 104.6 mph you will know that with the Ball tracker. The Play Maker will be an app that teams and coaches use to see what the best play for that situation is. Also the Play Maker will try to predicts the other team's play and finds a way to beat it. The Hype-O-Meter is a software that tracks how good or hype a play is based on how close the game was, how loud was the crowd, and how it affects the team win percentage. For example a hail mary touchdown to take the lead will be good for the Hype-O-Meter because it was the good and hype play and it affected the lead of the game. These are some for the ideas that will chage sports forever.  </p>

```
### A-frame
I had to create a A-frame to show an example of my ideas that can change the sports world. I had to use the skills that I had learn to make this A-frame. I imitated the **Ball tracking** device to implement into A-frame. I created the **Ball tracking** device by tracking a ball using the A-frame capabillty. 

### Conclusion
After I created the A-frame I explained the A-frame. After that I made a conclusion and that is the end of the website.

```
<img src="aiumps.jpeg" alt="Robot Ump" width= "500" height="10">
              <p>Click <a href="FreedomA-frame.html">here</a> to see some of the capability of the Ball tracking device works.</p>
              <p>As you can see the ball was tracked with the cylinders from the center to the left. This is only a little of what the Ball tracking device is able to do. </p>

              <div id="Conclusion"></div>
              <h3 class= "Conclusion"> Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In conclusion even though technology has helped sports grow and evole, my ideas can make sports better than it ever was before.</p>

## EDP
I am currently in the fourth and fifth stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to plan out the most promising solution and create a prototype. Why I think I am in this step in the Engineering Design Process is I am using A-frame to create a prototype and I writing about planing out the most promising and possible solution. The next stage is to test and evaluate the prototype.

## Skills
Some skills that I’ve learned since learning A-frame are **Attention to detail**, and **Time management**.

### Time management
While working on the website I also on vacation in Puerto Rico. I had to manage time doing this, time with family, time relaxing. So I set curtain days to work on the website. The rest of the days in PR can be with family or relaxing the hot weather. With this scheduling I finish the website and had fun in Puerto Rico with my family. Now I have learned to balance time to do certain things.

### Attention to detail
With making a website I have to be perfect or the whole website can crash or look terrible. So I have to pay attention to detail to make it look perfect. 


## Next Steps
I am looking forward to build something better for my freedom project website!
