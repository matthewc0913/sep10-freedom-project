                  <p>When people think of sports they think of playing, watching, winning, losing and having a good time. But no one thinks of the software or hardware. Maybe because they donâ€™t understand it. Maybe they don't care. But without technology you would have no way to watch your favorite teams, players or your favorite sports. Without technology players would get injured more, bad calls get reversed, and how good or bad your favorite players are doing. Coaches would need technology to know what is the right play in the situation. So maybe when you think about sports you should also think about how technology affects it.

              <p>People have made inventions in the past using technology. Some inventions are:</p>
              <li>Wearable player tracking devices</li>
              <li>Instant Replay</li>
              <ul>`</ul>
              <p>Technology has affceted some parts of sports that did not use technology in the past. For example scouts have scouted their talent based on guts, feelings and instincts. That's how Micheal Jordan signed with Nike to make his shoes. Now, through technology, scouts have a lot of information on how fast an athlete can run, how high they can jump and how hard they can throw and many other stats. Not to mention how techonogy has affected safety for players. Without technology wathletes would continue to get hurt at a constant rate. But their is still room for improvement. I have ideas for 4 new inventions that with technonlgy with can make sports better than what it is now. </p>
