* What I did was I created a box, a sphere, a cylinder, a plane, and the sky. I also changed the color of every shape to a different color from they was before. For example I changed the box's color to green, the cylinder's color to red, the sphere's color to yellow, the plane's color to brown, and the sky's color to light blue.
* My next steps is try to move the shapes and enlarge or shorten the shapes too and move the hieght of the shapes and create more shapes like a triangle.
